									<h2>The Scientific Data Method: Applied to mapping police use-of-force in America</h2>
									<p>Introduction.</p>
									<p>Growing up, I think back to school when I first learned about the scientific method, and I remember having little to no interest. Fast forward a decade; now, I am a scientist who enjoys thoroughly exploring each step and its application to data science. Science at its core is an exciting subject because we use it all the time, and sometimes we don’t even realize we’re thinking scientifically. Let’s take the scientific method, apply a pinch of data science, and walk through an experiment to explore how easy a project t can implement the scientific data method...</p>

									<h2>A Look into Applied Machine Learning</h2>
									<p>Naturally, I believe it is exciting for anyone to want to learn about the artificial intelligence (AI) environment and, more specifically, how a system can automate learning based on its own experiences. Humans possess the ability to learn from past experiences with potential self-improving benefits. Machines, on the other hand, follow the instructions given to them by humans. But, what if humans can train the machines to do what humans can do but more efficiently? Well, this is called machine learning. You can view machine learning as the man behind the curtain to your Spotify Discover Weekly Playlist, the female voice behind your phone’s virtual personal assistant, the eye behind the facial recognition technology securing your cell phone, or the guard filtering “spam” in your email. These are just a few of many examples of the role machine learning plays in our everyday lives. The goal is to guide you through the basics of machine learning and tasks involved.
										As I’ve mentioned prior, humans improve based on experiences, and machines need a set of tasks to complete with large amounts of data to enable them the “experiences” they lack. I used a data set that initially featured in an article written by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019. this data set contains hotel booking information City and Resort Hotel the information inside includes guessing information such as the type of hotel, the duration of a guest visit, the number of individuals staying at the hotel, any special accommodations, and much more. Each attribute about a guest stay at the hotel lives in a column within the data set we caught these columns features. The shape of this data presents 119,930 guests (rows) and thirty-two features (columns). To explain this seemingly complicated process, I will break down the machine learning project into seven main steps...</p>

									<h2>How does Spotify know what I like?</h2>
									<p>“Music has a profound ability to alter the way we feel, boost energy levels, calm us down, and unite us with others. We’ve all experienced a time when a song brought us to tears, unified us with a group during a concert, or pushed us to run that extra block.”</p>
									<p>If you typed into Google, “How does Spotify know what I like?”, the search results would probably be in the millions that all surround the simple answer I have learned at Lambda to call an algorithm or a calculated recipe, but we’ll get to algorithms a bit later. I’m sure many of my cohorts can agree that they have exhausted through their favorite playlists once or twice during their studies as data scientists. Some may use it as motivation during their morning ritual to get up at 8 in the morning and some may play it in the background while they study to offset the stresses of learning a new trade. For me, I like to think of it as a baby monitor. You know, the little square box that you keep with you all around the house and every time you listen to it there are little giggles of joy, screams from fear or for hunger, or just a calming silence. With such custom-curated playlists like Discovery Weekly and Made for You, and being the top leader in music streaming with over 200 million active users and over 50 million songs, I often ask myself, “How does Spotify measure and predict my palette for music?...</p>
